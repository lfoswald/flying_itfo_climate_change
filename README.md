This repository contains python and R code related to an environmental psychology project examining the social drivers of individual air travel. 

In order to calculate the distances of travels that participants reported in the questionnaire, a distance request was run in the form of an automated web scrape request on the distance calculator webpage (www.distance.to) using Python. 

The data preparation and statistical analyses were conducted in R.
